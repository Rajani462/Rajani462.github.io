    <h3>PTSTORM - Extreme Precipitation Response to Temperature Variations: The Role of Storm Types and Global Circulation Patterns </h3>
    <p><em>The Role of Storm Types and Global Circulation Patterns (MSCA Fellowship, University of Padova, 2025–2027)</em></p>
    <p>The overarching objective of ‘Extreme Precipitation Response to Temperature Variations: The Role of Storm Types and Global Circulation Patterns (PTSTORM)’ is to improve our under-
standing of the relation between extreme precipitation and atmospheric temperature. Current
approaches use scaling relations that mimic the exponential increase of water vapor availability
with temperature predicted by the Clausius–Clapeyron equation. These approaches fail to con-
sider that extreme events are generated by diverse physical processes, which may be influenced
by large-scale drivers. PTSTORM will provide a more realistic representation of the relationship
between extreme precipitation and temperature by explicitly considering the dependence on the
generating precipitation process and on large-scale atmospheric circulation (LAC) patterns.. Key objectives:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Classify storm types and associated precipitation characteristics globally.</li>
      <li>Quantify temperature–precipitation scaling across storm types and regions.</li>
      <li>Assess modulation of extremes by large-scale circulation regimes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>We combine satellite products (e.g., GPM IMERG), reanalysis datasets, and statistical models. Results will inform process-based interpretations and improve predictive models for extreme precipitation under changing climate conditions.</p>
    <h3>Funding</h3>
    <p>Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Postdoctoral Fellowship — €193,643.</p>
